Tip: In order to understand power2 metod:

   -First  iteration:\
	power = 10 (Decimal) = 1010 (Binary) (even number)\
	power ------------> 1010\
        0x1   ---------------> 0001\
	---------------------------\
  power & 0x1 ----> 0000  so if(0)

   -Second  iteration:\
	power = 5 (Decimal) = 0101 (Binary) (odd number)\
	power ------------> 0101\
        0x1   ---------------> 0001\
	---------------------------\
  power & 0x1 ----> 0001  so if(1)

   -Third  iteration:
	power = 2 (Decimal) = 0010 (Binary) (even number)\
	power ------------> 0010\
        0x1   ---------------> 0001\
	---------------------------\
  power & 0x1 ----> 0000  so if(0)

   -Fourth  iteration:
	power = 1 (Decimal) = 0001 (Binary) (odd number)\
	power ------------> 0001\
        0x1   ---------------> 0001\
	---------------------------\

## 02 - Recursive Algorithms

### MemorySpaceOfProgram

Main goal is: Computing the sum of numbers which are passed to function.

Shortly Briefing: Before starting recursively computing sum of the numbers, We need to understand memory space how it works. Memory space of program dived into 3 parts which are heap, stack and global. Global variables are stored in global and these variables are reachable from any function. Temporary variables are stored in stack. These temporary variables are parameters of functions and local variables of functions. When the functions begin to implement, these temporary variables are allocating in stack. Than the function complete its implemantation, these temporary variables goes to delete from stack. Lastly, variable which are allacoted dynamically stored in heap.

For example the screenshoot which is at above is visualization of the explanation. When Sum1 function is called and than  begin to  implementation of fucntion, local variable and parameters of function are stored in stack temporary. When function return the result of function, local variables and paremeters of functions which are x, y and z will be deleted from stack. At the end, When main function is complete its mission, lacal varaible of main function also will be deleted from stack.

### Addition

- S(n) Space complexity of Sum1 metod: O(n) , there are "n" invocation frames on the stack at the same time.

- T(n) Time complexity of Sum2 metod : if n = 1 (Base case) -> T(1) = 1 -> O(1), if n > 1 T(n) = T(n-1) + 1 -> O(n)
- S(n) Space complexity of Sum2 metod: O(n) , there are "n" invocation frames on the stack at the same time.
